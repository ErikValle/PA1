# Programming Assignment 1 coding template
## Steps
* Implement `RidgeRegression.train` in `ridge_regression.py`
* Implement `Logistic._iteration_step` in `logistic_regression.py`
* Implement `Logistic.predict_proba` in `logistic_regression.py`
* Run `python3 test.py` to verify your implementation
## Grading details
For each question, there are 3 tests `test.py`:
* Pass all 3 tests: 5 score
* Pass 2 tests: 4 score
* Pass 1 test: 3 score
* Pass 0 test: 2 score
## Tips to run the test
You can use test filter to only run partial test in your environment.
For example, to run only ridge regression test, use the command
`python3 test.py TestRidgeModel`. This could help you focus on debugging
one model at each time.
